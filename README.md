# nlibc

i'm trying to write a "kernel" in nim. but to do that i need a lib c to make nim work. i want to write the "kernel" in as much nim as possible so i decided to write a libc in nim.
this is for me than it is for you (sorry) so it will only contain the things i need to get my "kernel" working.
